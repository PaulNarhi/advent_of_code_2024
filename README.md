# Advent of Code 2024
This repo contains the solutions for Advent of Code 2024 using python and numpy. Point of the solutions is to try to learn new stuff for python, thus some of the code may be unoptimal

As per request of organizers, the repo does not contain plain text inputs. To allow for usage between computers without fetching inputs from the site, Fernet encryption is used. To use the script run
```bash
python script.py <day> <operation>
```
in the terminal. A valid fernet key must be in the env file
